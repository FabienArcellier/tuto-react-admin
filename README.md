# Tutorial React Admin

![ci](https://github.com/FabienArcellier/tuto-react-admin/workflows/ci/badge.svg)

I would recommand you to clone directly the react-admin repository. It contains the result
of the tutorial. This one is just an implementation I have done for my own test. I stop the
tutorial long before the end before I already have the insight I need.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

1. clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:FabienArcellier/tuto-react-admin.git
```

2. execute the webserver

```bash
npm run start
```
